# CSE 373 Final
## Part 1: Graph Algorithm Design
This is a pretty challenging programming assignment focused primarily on Graph Algorithm Design, so be sure to allocate an appropriate amount of time to this. Make sure to get your code pushed on-time Thursday night!

### Installation
You can obtain the final project code similarly to how you obtained code elsewhere in this class - through using the clone through SSH button on GitLab.

## Part 2: Iterative Design - Given Redesign

See instructions for the Part 2: Iterative Design Writeup on canvas. 

Your redesign is given below, but you don't need to turn in anything related to the iterative design final on Gitlab, you only need to turn in your writeup document on Canvas!

### Utilize Husky Maps for Public Construction Projects
Enhance Husky Maps to support the public construction sector.
1. **Data Structure Representation:**
Describe the data structures and graph representations used to store roads, proposed routes, gas stations, and locations.
2. **Functionalities:**
    - **Add Proposed Routes:** Add proposed routes to Husky Maps for construction purposes.
    - **Find Cheapest Connections:** Identify the most cost-effective way to connect cities with no existing roads. The government also requires that you build the cheapest road connection between city A and city B (it can be an indirect path through multiple cities if itâ€™s cheaper). You are given proposed routes of where to build, city A and city B. Note that when a distance is smaller, the amount of material cost will be cheaper.
    - **Determine Gas Station Placement:** Determine the placement of k gas stations along roads to ensure that cars traveling longer stretches between cities have access to fuel.



## Authors and acknowledgment
It took a lot of work to bring this to life from concepts from prior quarters. Hopefully this final brings value to you and helps you encapsulate the knowledge you have gained throughout CSE 373.
